# 📊 Case Study: Improving Average Handling Time (AHT)

## 🏆 Objective  

Reduce **Average Handling Time (AHT)** for the customer support process while maintaining **high CSAT (Customer Satisfaction)** and **service quality**.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement  

The contact center team was experiencing **high AHT**, leading to:  
- Increased operational cost per interaction  
- Reduced agent availability for new tickets  
- Missed SLA (Service Level Agreement) on peak days  
- Impact on overall **customer experience and productivity**

## 🧠 Root Cause Analysis  

I led a **structured RCA (Root Cause Analysis)** using a **Waterfall-style approach** and the **4D Coaching Model (Define → Discover → Develop → Deliver)**:

| Step | Key Actions |
|------|-------------|
| **Define** | Collected AHT data from Amazon Connect and JIRA reports; identified top 3 workflows with the highest AHT |
| **Discover** | Analyzed call recordings, agent notes, and ticket logs; conducted agent interviews |
| **Develop** | Identified redundant steps and created optimized call scripts; designed agent training plan |
| **Deliver** | Rolled out process changes, automated repetitive tasks with macros, and introduced real-time dashboards |

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used  

- **Amazon Connect** – Call data extraction and workflow monitoring  
- **Power BI** – Built dashboards to track AHT trends & improvements  
- **Excel (Pivot Tables & Macros)** – Automated AHT reporting  
- **JIRA** – Ticket analysis for resolution patterns  
- **4D Coaching Model** – Guided team members on skill gaps and efficiency techniques

## 📈 Solution Implementation  

✅ **Process Optimization** – Streamlined call flow, reduced redundant questions  
✅ **Training & Coaching** – Conducted sessions on effective probing, quick documentation  
✅ **Automation** – Automated report generation, freeing up agent time  
✅ **Real-Time Tracking** – Power BI dashboard for live AHT monitoring
